Atomic Design with React

The [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) approach comes handy to solve this problem because it considers the reusability through composition, *which is actually what React is*. You will have your minimal/stylish components in one folder, pages in another and so on.

## Setup

### 1. Get the source code

Just clone one of the ARc [branches](#branches):
```sh
$ git clone -b master https://github.com/VellaimaryCJ/atomic-design-react my-app
$ cd my-app


### 2. Install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

### 3. Run the app

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Now you can open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:3000) in browser and start developing.
